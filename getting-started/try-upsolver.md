# Try Upsolver for free

To help you get started with Upsolver, you can try it out for free. You can choose between [**Upsolver Dedicated Compute**](https://app.upsolver.com/signup) ****and [**Community**](https://app.upsolver.com/signup/free) subscriptions. Both options give you free Upsolver units \(UUs\), units of processing capability per hour based on VM instance type.

Upsolver Dedicated Compute is more flexible, but Upsolver uses compute and S3 storage resources in your AWS account. During the sign-up process you grant Upsolver privileges to access your AWS account.

Upsolver Community is fully resourced; you are not required to supply any compute or storage resources.

You can also use Upsolver through [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07T8JDQ57?ref_=srh_res_product_title). All of the options will allow you to ingest data to Amazon S3, perform transformations with simple SQL, and output to your favorite database or analytics toolsâ€”in minutes.
