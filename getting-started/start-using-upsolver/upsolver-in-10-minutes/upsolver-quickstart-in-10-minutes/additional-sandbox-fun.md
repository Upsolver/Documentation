We have pre-created sample data sources used by the queries in the worksheets. You may explore the data sources by clicking on **DATA SOURCES &gt;  Upsolver Tutorial Order Bucket**

Upsolver parses data on read. It provides you with rich data demographics and statistics on each field. Upsolver supports all data formats and keeps an open format. 

A sample of the raw data from source can be viewed by clicking the **SAMPLES** tab.
